# Airbnb Data Exploration
In this repo i will go through airbnb data with CRISP-DM to look for more insight and model the data
Feel free to read my [Blog Post!](https://medium.com/@alnassarnasser/airbnb-the-illusion-of-a-good-choice-ec30442d5a93)

# Quickstart
> [!NOTE]
> When using pandas, make sure to check what the actual methods and functions are doing, go step by step and print every step along the way, you will save yourself a lot of headaches!


## Installation
-Install the required libraries by running the following command:
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Libraries Used in the Repository


-[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a data manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures and functions for efficiently handling and analyzing **structured** data.


-[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and tools needed for machine learning task and sciency projects in general.


-[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) is a versatile machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, along with utilities for model evaluation and data preprocessing. even though it is pretty high-level compared to pytorch or tensorflow, it gets the job done.


-[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
