# Airbnb Data Exploration
In this repo i will go through airbnb data with CRISP-DM to look for more insight and model the data

# Quickstart
> [!NOTE]
> When using pandas, make sure to check what the actual methods and functions are doing, go step by step and print every step along the way, you will save yourself a lot of headaches!


## Installation
-Install the required libraries by running the following command:
